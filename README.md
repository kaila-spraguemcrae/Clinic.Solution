## Installation Requirements

#### Installing Git

###### For Mac Users

- Access Terminal in your Finder, and open a new window. Install the package manager, (Homebrew) [https://brew.sh/], on your device by entering this line of code in Terminal: `$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.
- Ensure Homebrew packages are run with this line of code: `echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile`.
- Once homebrew is installed, install Git, a version control system for code writers, with this line of code `brew install git`.

###### For Windows Users

- Open a new Command Prompt window by typing "Cmd" in your computer's search bar.
- Determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by following these (instructions)[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running].
- Go to (Git Bash)[https://gitforwindows.org/], click on the "Download" button, and download the corresponding exe file from the Git for Windows site.\_
- Follow the instructions in the set up menu.

#### For Both Mac & Windows systems

- Once you have Git installed on your computer, go to this (GitHub repository)[https://github.com/ebezjian/Clinic.Solution], click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the page, and clone this application with the following command:`git clone https://github.com/ebezjian/Clinic.Solution.git`.

#### Installing C#, .NET, dotnet script, & MySQL


- Install C# and .Net according to your operating system below.

###### For Mac

- Download this .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit)[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer]. Clicking this link will prompt a .pkg file download from Microsoft.
- Open the .pkg file. This will launch an installer which will walk you through installation steps. Use the default settings the installer suggests.
- Confirm the installation is successful by opening your terminal and running the command $ dotnet --version, which should return something like: `2.2.105`.

###### For Windows (10+)

- Download either the the 64-bit .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit)[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer]. Clicking these links will prompt a .exe file download from Microsoft.
- Open the file and follow the steps provided by the installer for your OS.
- Confirm the installation is successful by opening a new Windows PowerShell window and running the command dotnet --version. You should see something a response like this: `2.2.105`.

#### For Mac & Windows Operating Systems

- Install dotnet script with the following terminal command `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`.

#### Setting up a Local Database

- Download [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914).
- Download [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391).
- (For more detailed instructions if either of the above technologies are unfamiliar to you, visit [this site](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql)).
- Run `dotnet build` when the project is on your local machine.
- Run `dotnet ef migrations add Initial`
  --> If there is an error stating "Unable to resolve project", this means the command wasn't run in the correct directory.
- Entity creates three files in the Migrations directory.
- Run the following command: `dotnet ef database update`.

#### create appsetting.json

Once the project has been cloned to your computer and you have all the necessary items on your local computer, open the project in the application of your choice.

Create a file in the root directory of the project called "appsettings.json". Add the following snippet of code to the appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=clinic;uid=root;pwd=YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE;"
    }
}
```

Where you see "YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE" is where you put the password you created for your MySQL server. Your server name and port might vary depending on your local system. Check MySQL Workbench Connections to determine if the local host and port number match and adjust as needed.


#### Opening the Project on your Local System

- Navigate to the project folder on your Terminal or CMD.

- `dotnet build` will get bin/ and obj/ folders downloaded.
- `dotnet restore` to install packages listed in project's boilerplate.
- `dotnet run` will run the application.
